Handshake is a small library which helps you create, validate handshakes between
client and server. To make this module as flexible and extendible as possible we
don't make any assumptions about properties the data that should be returned in
the handshake the only requirements we set are:

- It should be an object with keys so we can transform the key and value's to a
  query string.

So you might wonder why we went with a query string. There a couple of good
reasons about this. When we are handshaking we do not know which protocols the
server and clients support so we cannot encode and decode the data yet. So we
need to have an encoding format which is super easy to parse for both the server
and clients. In addition to that it's easy to debug as it's a human readable
format.

## Installation

The module is released in the public npm registry and can be installed using:

```
npm install --save handshake
```

## Usage

In all the examples we assume that you've already required and setup the
Handshake instance using:

```js
'use strict';

var Handshake = require('handshake');
```

To construct a new `Handshake` instance we need two things:

1. A context/scope/this value for all the callbacks that we execute. Which is
   required but can be set to null, undefined or whatever.
2. Options for further configuring the handshake.

So for the optional options, you can supply the following properties:

- **`handshake timeout`** Maximum time a user is allowed to spend to modifying
  the handshake data. As the last thing we want to do is introduce extra
  latency. Defaults to `5 seconds`.
- **`stringify`** Custom stringify method which will be used to completely
  encode the handshake. Defaults to `querystringify.stringify`.
- **`id`** Unique id generator which will be called for each `handshake.get`
  call. Defaults to `uuid.v4`.

For our examples we just assume it has been setup as following:

```js
var handshake = new Handshake();
```

### set

The set method allows you to assign properties on the handshake that should be
added to every `.get` call. The method accepts 2 arguments.

1. `key` The name of the property which should be added to the handshake.
2. `value` The value that needs to be stored. If you supply a function it will
   be called every time the `handshake.update()` method is called. The returned
   result of the function will be set as result.

```js
handshake
.set('version', require('./package.json').version)
.set('another', 'value')
.set('generated', function () {
  return 'foo';
});
```

### update

Configure/compile the default values of the handshake payload. This way we don't
have to re-compile the data every single time a handshake is requested. You
should call the `update` method once you are done with setting all your
properties using the `.set` method.

```js
handshake
.set('version', require('./package.json').version)
.set('another', 'value');

handshake.update();
```

### get

This is where all the magic happens, this is the api what it's all about. It
gets the handshake payload. The `get` method requires 2 arguments:

1. **Modify** A function which is called with the handshake object before it's
   encoded. This allows you to modify and add values to the handshake. If the
   function has 1 argument we assume it's a synchronous call, if it has 2
   arguments we see it as an async call and add a callback function as last
   argument.
2. **Complete** The completion callback which follows an error first callback
   pattern.

Errors are automatically handled by this function. When you return an error in
sync mode, provide an error as first argument in async mode or if we fail to
encode the object we will encode a special object which will have an `error`
property set to the error message and we will supply this as data argument to
the complete function. Don't worry, we will also still set the error argument
but this way you will always have data to return.

```js
handshake.get(function modify(payload) {
  payload.foo = 'bar';
}, function generated(err, data) {
  // do things
});
```

### destroy

Destroy the created handshake instance. This releases all internal references so
it can be reclaimed by the garbage collector.

```js
handshake.destroy();
```
